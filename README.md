# Maze Solver using A* Search

This project implements a Maze Solver using the A* (A-star) search algorithm in Python.

## Description
- A maze is generated using the pyamaze library.
- A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path.
- Manhattan distance is used as the heuristic function.
- The solution path is visually traced in the maze.
- Handles cases where no path exists.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pyamaze
- A* Search Algorithm

## How to Run
1. Install dependency:
   python -m pip install pyamaze
2. Run the program:
   python pyamaze_astar.py

## Output
- Displays the maze
- Shows the shortest path using A*
- Displays the path length
